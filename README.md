Information about my starlink experience, with statistics and monitoring information etc.

## Location
Eastern Townships, Quebec, Canada.

Latitude: 45.64

## Background

During the work from home period 2020-2021 the vacation home and apartment switched roles. Unfortunately the chalet did not have any other option than 5/1 Mbps ADSL connection from [Bell](http://www.bell.ca) phone lines. The subscription is through [Virgin](https://www.virginmobile.ca/en/home/index.html), $30 per line per month. 2 Lines with a [TL-R470T+ load balancer](https://www.tp-link.com/us/business-networking/load-balance-router/tl-r470t+/). There is a nearby Bell tower that can deliver 200+ Mbps but neither my wallet nor my company phone manager would accept that as primary network access.

The ADSL lines work pretty well to load balance and [fast.com](http://fast.com) can sometimes max it at 11-12 MBps which means that [Virgin](https://www.virginmobile.ca/en/home/index.html) usually deliver the posted speed for the plan and sometimes even more. The bad thing is that you need to call them every time the line goes bad and they will reconfigure the connection.

One ADSL line will be kept as failover until Starlink is proven reliable for full work days.

## [Dishy Placement](./placement/)

There are some trees that is blocking to the west/north. The starlink status page shows mixed amounts of red all the way between W and N. The other directions are clear.

### Initial test setup

Placed the Dishy with the tripod in the garden, some tomato plant obstructions. 

Initial speed test: 120 MBps

The dishy is mounted with the tripod on top of a metal pole that is in turn mounted in an [Oasis tripod](http://www.satelliteoasis.com/2-in-od-satellite-dish-tripod-for-directv-slimline-hd-dish/). Placed in the garden corner next to the tomato plants.
